# GitNinjaDashboard 
This is a Dashboard to view your Git Activity Feed. To view a demo of this project, you can visit www.blameitondenton.com


#NinjaSkills
The Git Ninja's job is to keep you up to date on the latest changes in the Git world. The Ninja brings you all the git activity you could ever want, into one beautiful page. There is no need to log in to view the public feed. You may browse and wander around without anyone knowing you were there. 

The Ninja isn't limited to watching others though. If you are brave enough, you can jump into your own GitHub suit and Join him in all of your glory!  Stand beside the Ninja proud and he will provide your with endless knowledge. Once you have accepted your identity, and proved yourself to the GitGawds that you have earned your sacred password, the Git Ninja will reward you by given you a introspective view of your past activities, so that you may learn from your mistakes and revel in your triumphs! 

#NinjaSkillsPublicEdition
Once on the Ninja Dashboard, you will be able to see the public activity feed. To get a more detailed view of the event, you may click on the event to expand the description. For an even further drive, you can click on the link provided to be transfered directly to the repository's page. Tip- to update the current public feed, you can use the Update Feed Button provided. 

Signing into the Ninja Dashboard gives you the ability to see and track your own Github activity. Similar to the public feed, you can dive deeper into each event, or be delivered directly to the repository that the event is located in.
